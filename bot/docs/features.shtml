<li>"As a side note, last night on the pub server we were playing Lawrence and some bots and they were kicking our ass. Finally, we turned the tide by taking down some hives and one of the marines said 'I don't just want to beat these guys anymore, lets humiliate them'.  He was quite surprised when I told him that all but one of the aliens were bots and thus couldn't be humiliated. hehehe. He said they were the smartest NS bots he's ever played against." -- WhichBot playtester
<li>I gotta say that I love the whichbots.  They play aliens, and they do kick arse. They play nasty, and are mean enough to give experienced marines a run for their money. -- PetitMorte (<a href="http://www.natural-selection.org/forums/index.php?act=ST&f=8&t=40072&hl=whichbot&s=277e37b4f162d604d4320bbf3c3490a4">link</a>)
<li>... Great job guys! These whichbots are uber intelligent and did not fall for many glitch tricks! -- Freak83 (<a href="http://www.natural-selection.org/forums/index.php?s=277e37b4f162d604d4320bbf3c3490a4&act=ST&f=1&t=31861&hl=whichbot&st=60">link</a>)
