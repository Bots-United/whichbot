* Fixed a bug in v0.94b which was causing bots to instantly forget entities as soon as they saw them.

* Tweaked Onos and Fade attack code so hopefully they'll hit players a bit more (previously they would miss if the
  player was crouching).

* Updated bundled Metamod versions to v1.17.3 from metamod.org.

* Finally got round to upgrading the dev environment on Windows to VS .Net 2003.

* Added some compiler optimisation options on Linux.

* Added an experimental tweak to disable ambush mode if bots see a phasegate.

* Added configuration of bot roles to the config file.
