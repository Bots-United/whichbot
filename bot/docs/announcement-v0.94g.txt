* Reverse-engineered and updated code for changed binary protocols in NS3.0 final.  Note that this means that this
  version of WhichBot is only compatible with NS3.0 final.

* Fixed a bug where Fades weren't charged energy to blink.  This should hopefully reduce some of the crazy blinking we
  were seeing.

* Added Sandman[SA]'s latest waypoints for co_core and ns_eclipse.  Thanks!

* Added a new feature to AttackStrategy - auditory traces of marines are now treated as a parasited marine.  This means
  that bots will hunt down marines they can hear but not see and also track down marines they remembered hearing
  recently.  One-hive gorges should also stay away from marines.

* Reduced the influence of parasited marines (also see previous change) so bots aren't quite as excited about hunting
  them down.

* Upped the influence of marine resource towers to help bots keep the squeeze on marine res.
