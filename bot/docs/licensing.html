<h2>WhichBot Licensing</h2>
   WhichBot is more-or-less free. &nbsp;From a user's point of view, that's
pretty much true.<br>
 <br>
 If you plan to use any parts of the code, however, things get more complicated.<br>
   <br>
   Some parts of the code are covered by different licenses. &nbsp;Most  of
the project code is covered by the <a
 href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD License.</a>
 &nbsp;<br>
<br>

 However, since the project also uses the Half-Life SDK, the project  in toto
is also covered by the Half-Life SDK license.  Here's that license text:
   
<pre>*	Copyright (c) 1996-2002, Valve LLC. All rights reserved.<br>*	<br>*	This product contains software technology licensed from Id <br>*	Software, Inc. ("Id Technology").  Id Technology (c) 1996 Id Software, Inc. <br>*	All Rights Reserved.<br>*<br>*   Use, distribution, and modification of this source code and/or resulting<br>*   object code is restricted to non-commercial enhancements to products from<br>*   Valve LLC.  All other use, distribution, or modification is prohibited<br>*   without written permission from Valve LLC.<br></pre>
    <br>
   On top of that, it's also partially covered by the GPL variant license
in Metamod.  Here's the relevant text:
