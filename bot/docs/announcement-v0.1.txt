We have a new NS bot for the alien team, WhichBot.  Right now it's in
alpha testing, and doesn't have a lot of features - it only works on
ns_tanith, and does not evolve to anything beyond skulk.

However, it should be fairly playable for LAN games.  We don't currently
regard it as mature enough to run on public servers.

Here's what it does do:
+ evolves upgrades
+ remembers marine building locations
+ chooses and switches weapons reasonably intelligently
+ eats marines for breakfast, elevenses, lunch, dinner and supper.  And
maybe a midnight snack.

Here's what it doesn't do:
- respond to hive/building attacks
- have a human-like sensory model
- have human-like movement behaviour
- have difficulty settings
- gorge (this usually means you need at least one human alien player right now)

The homepage for the bot is here:
