<i>by Clamatius.</i></head><body>

<p>This behaviour description was written for WhichBot version v0.92e.  I'll describe the behaviour for Natural
Selection, rather than Natural Selection: Combat, since the normal gameplay mode was the main focus of the bot design.  However, obviously a lot of this will still apply to Combat
since it's really a subset of the problem.

<p>You can find out what all the bots are thinking and currently trying to do via the new "wb status" command, which makes them
do an alien teamsay describing their current high level strategies.  I should caution you that in v0.92e there seems to be a bug in the command which causes a crash sometimes and I haven't isolated the cause yet.

<h4>High level behaviour</h4>

<p>High level behaviour for WhichBot isn't really that high level - they don't yet do any formal planning or analysis.
However, they do a lot more than simply react to what they see.  As Natural Selection is a team game, the bots
share information with each other via a "noticeboard" where they can post useful information that may help other bots (e.g. marine building locations, waypoints they have visited, etc).

<p>Gorges should try to set up alien buildings.  They should also try to avoid marine buildings when they only have 1
hive.  They will wait at a build point for some time if they don't have enough resources at that moment.  The build order is
fixed at the low end at something like RT/RT/RT/DC/DC/DC/Hive2/MC/MC/MC and after that it may vary.  If the build order
is severely disrupted somehow and a gorge ends up with a lot of resources before hive 2 is up, it will go and try to build it.
<p>Non-gorge bots have a current lifeform and a target lifeform.  They will form packs of up to 3 bots.  The pack leader
is the highest lifeform in the pack.  The pack leader role may be reassigned within the pack as bots evolve or die.  The pack leader chooses where to go and pack
followers main priority is usually following the pack leader.  Pack leaders will wait at waypoints for a time if they can't see
their followers.  Pack followers will wait at waypoints if the leader has stopped and they are next to it.  As an
interesting tweak, packs can be "slaved" to human players where the pack leaders seek the human player instead of their
normal behaviour, which allows for some basic human/AI teamwork.

<p>Normal behaviour for a pack leader is a blend of Scout/Seek/Rescue/Flee/Combat strategies.  Weightings of the different strategies depend on configuration
settings and some hard-coded and situation-dependent settings.

<ul><li>Scout: Travel towards hive locations and resource nozzles to look for marines and marine buildings.    Onos and
Fades are much less likely to scout (their value for a is much lower).  The formula for the reward
is <code>at<sup>2</sup>I e<sup>(-br)</sup></code> where a and b are constants, I is the configured influence, t is the time since last visit and r is the estimated travel time to the location.
<li>Seek: Travel towards known marine building positions and parasited marines.  The formula
for the reward is <code>aIe<sup>(-br)</sup></code>where a and b are constants, I is the configured influence, and r is the estimated travel time
to the location.
<li>Rescue: Only active for a little while when a hive, RT or structure near a hive is attacked. The bot gets a large
reward for travelling to the attacked structure.  At time of writing the bots aren't smart enough to seek out an active
siege firing at the structure unless they happen across it on the way.
<li>Flee: Active when the bot is wounded.  The bot will seek out hives and defense chambers to heal itself.  While this
is active, a lot of the other behaviours shut down.
<li>Combat: Active in combat mode.  The bot uses this strategy to navigate to its combat target.  The bot receives a
large fixed reward which should effectively dominate all other behaviours.
</ul>

<h4>Pathfinding</h4>

<h4>Low level behaviour</h4>

<p>The bot mainly relies on human-placed waypoints for navigation.  It uses some simple reactive behaviours based on
robotics to move to waypoints - it extends "whiskers" at various angles around the front of the bot to detect obstacles
and adjust its movement angles accordingly.  Movement in Natural Selection is somewhat more complicated than other games
since some lifeforms can climb walls, travel through small air ducts and even fly!  Given time constraints on the project, I decided to use a simple waypointed system over a more elegant but
hard to implement system such as a navigation mesh variant.

<p>Note that the bot actually moves as a real player does - i.e. it submits commands to the
HL engine as a player instead of just moving itself.  This both simplifies movement problems and makes them more
complex.  On the minus side, due to framerate jitter, movement is not deterministic.  On the plus side, it means that
theoretically bots can't get into "impossible" states - e.g. stuck in walls, etc.

<p>Sensory information is currently sight-only with no field-of-view.  Audio management is planned but not implemented yet.
