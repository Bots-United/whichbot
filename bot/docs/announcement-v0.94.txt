Changes since v0.93:

* Updated Metamod on Windows to 1.17.2.1.  See here for details: http://www.natural-selection.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=79561&st=30.  This version seems to have the least compatibility issues of all the ones I tried.
* Updated Metamod on Linux to 1.17.2p10.  See here for details: http://forums.unitedadmins.com/index.php?showtopic=39088.    This version seems to have the least compatibility issues of all the ones I tried.
* Added a fix for a problem associated with HL moving time backwards a very small amount from frame to frame.  The symptom of this was that gorges would get very confused and start spinning in hive areas.
* Upgraded Linux build to gcc 3.2.3.
* Upgraded Windows build to Visual Studio 6, SP6.
* Upgraded STLport to 4.6.2.
* Link against Valve's HL .so in the Linux build.
* Updated to use libsupc++.a on Linux (static link of STLport).
* Added a method so bots can now tell if they're stuck to a ladder.
* Altered "hit waypoint" logic on ladders (should help with the problem where bots thought they'd got to the top of the ladder but hadn't).
* Don't run "back up and try again" routine when on a ladder.
* Don't jump when trying to climb a ladder.
* Fixed combat evolution issue in beta 5 - bots no longer have to evolve to gorge before other life forms.
* Fix for a problem where fades would often blink into the ceiling and stick there. Blinking now should be somewhat more controlled. Also fixed a bug where fades sometimes wouldn't slash marines when they could.
* Tweaked collision detection for Onos.  They would sometimes get stuck on low obstacles (especially alien buildings) and now they seem to be doing a bit better.
* New waypoints for NS 3.0 beta 5.  Updated maps from me: ns_nancy, ns_lost.  From gruuunt: co_core, co_daimos, co_sava, ns_agora, ns_altair, ns_bast, ns_hera, ns_metal.  Thanks gruuunt!
* Added a new command, "wb boost <number>", where the number should be an integer between 1 and 15. It gives all currently present bots a boost in xp/res. Note that you must do it after the round starts. This is still a work in progress - I realise it's hard currently for server admins to have an automatic boost for the bots. I'm planning to add more code to make that easier when time permits.

In Combat testing, "wb boost 3" made for a much more exciting game where the bots achieved the full range of lifeforms.

You can also enable "/wb boost" as a global say command by editing whichbot.txt.
UPDATE: I'm informed there's a bug in this command that gives experience to all alien players, not just bots.  I do not recommend you enable the global say command.
