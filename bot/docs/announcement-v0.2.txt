Version .2 alpha for WhichBot is ready!

Latest features:

  [*] HiveMind strategy manager helps to coordinate bots
  [*] Completely new navigation system which uses dynamic navigation
    calculation instead of precalculated paths
  [*] Tweaked reactive movement to reduce chances of getting stuck and
    improved fallback behaviour in case of sticking
  [*] Completely new strategy system that blends different behaviours
    for offense/defense
  [*] Communication with rest of alien team (bots tell you the location of
    new marine structures they find)
  [*] Improved waypoints for faster movement and better vent navigation
  [*] Config file management for tweaking of strategy values
  [*] Waypoint editing and debugging available

The dynamic navigation is particularly interesting compared with the more
static strategies that bots often use; an example might be
that a bot is going to attack the main marine base, but notices
that Reactor Room is near its route.  Since the HiveMind tells it none 
of the bots have been there for a while, it decides to take a slight detour
to make sure there aren't any RTs built there.

In technical terms, we do that by blending the scouting behaviour with
the attack behaviour.  Future versions will have even more behaviours
to blend, like "wolfpack", where bots tend to follow a leader and travel
in packs.

In the public test game last night of v0.2, the bots were managing a 1:3 kill
ratio, which isn't too bad for skulks against mines, turrets, HA and
and jetpacks.  There was one alien player (as gorge), in a mostly 5v5 game.

Oh, and if you're in a clan, you think you're good, and your clan would be
interested in playtesting new versions, please let me know.  We're also
looking for good demos of games against the bots.
