WhichBot Installation Instructions (STEAM)

Note that WhichBot includes Metamod.  If you already have Metamod installed, do 
not unzip the files in the ns\addons\metamod directory.

=======

a) Download the whichbot .zip file from the following page:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=76903

b) Unzip the zip file into your Natural Selection directory.  If you already
have Metamod installed, do not unzip the files in the ns\addons\metamod directory.
The directory structure should now include:

{steam half-life install directory}\ns\addons\metamod
{steam half-life install directory}\ns\addons\whichbot

c) Edit the file liblist.gam in your Natural Selection directory.  To edit
the file, use Notepad or a similar text editor.

There will be one line that looks like this:

gamedll "dlls\ns.dll"

Delete that line and add 2 new lines:

gamedll "addons\metamod\dlls\metamod.dll"
gamedll_linux "addons/metamod/dlls/metamod_i386.so"

d) You're done!  Run your server and type "wb add" on the console to add a bot, or "wb balance on" to turn team
auto-balance on.
