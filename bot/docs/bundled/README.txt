WhichBot README

WhichBot is an alien AI for Natural Selection.

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.txt.

For more details and to provide feedback, see

http://whichbot.com/

Did you like the bot?  Did you hate it?  Either way, let us know.

The following console commands are available:

* wb add - adds 1 bot, which will try to join the alien team

* wb remove - removes 1 bot

* wb balance on - turns on auto-team balancing, which will add bots 
and remove bots to keep the number of players on each
team the same.

* wb balance off - turns off auto-team balancing

* wb balance on - turns on auto-team balancing.  See the config file,
conf/whichbot.txt for more details.

In the default configuration, you can also add and remove bots via 
saying "/wb add" and "/wb remove" in global chat (not team chat).
If running a public server and people are abusing this feature, 
you can edit the bot config file, whichbot.txt, to disable it.
Note that this feature does not work in the latest NS beta at present.

To access console commands, run Half-Life like this:

c:\games\half-life>hl.exe -game ns -console


Additional console commands are available for waypointing.  See the 
forums and waypointing guide at whichbot.com for details.
