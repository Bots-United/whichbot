Changes since v0.94:

* Reverse-engineered and updated code for changed binary protocols in NS3.0 final.  Note that this means that this
  version of WhichBot is only compatible with NS3.0 final.

* Updated all included waypoints for NS3.0 final.  This is due to a lot of hard work from Sandman[SA] (NS maps), Gruuunt
  (CO maps) and allnighterinva (co_sava).  Thanks guys!

* Tweaked Onos and Fade attack code so hopefully they'll hit players a bit more (previously they would miss if the
  player was crouching).

* Fades and Onos now duck to attack close crouching marines if the marine is on the same level with them or lower. This will hopefully fix the "fade crouch" exploit. 
 
* Added config tweak to whichbot.txt which allows server admins to make "wb balance" trigger off the number of marines rather than the number of human players.

* Updated bundled Metamod versions to v1.17.3 from metamod.org.

* Finally got round to upgrading the dev environment on Windows to VS .Net 2003.

* Added some compiler optimisation options on Linux.

* Added tweak to disable ambush mode if bots see a phasegate.

* Added configuration of bot roles to the config file.

* Fixed a bug where Fades weren't charged energy to blink.  This should hopefully reduce some of the crazy blinking we
  were seeing.

* Added Sandman[SA]'s latest waypoints for co_core and ns_eclipse.  Thanks!

* Added a new feature to AttackStrategy - auditory traces of marines are now treated as a parasited marine.  This means
  that bots will hunt down marines they can hear but not see and also track down marines they remembered hearing
  recently.  One-hive gorges should also stay away from marines.

* Reduced the influence of parasited marines (also see previous change) so bots aren't quite as excited about hunting
  them down.

* Upped the influence of marine resource towers to help bots keep the squeeze on marine res.

* Fixed a bug that was causing bots to only pick celerity, no more upgrades, in Combat. 
 
* From testing, determined that Onos are so much worse than Fades in Combat that for now WB only goes for Fade in
  Combat.

* Fixed a bug that was causing "wb status" to crash when it was called when a bot was spawning in and its path manager
  was in an invalid state. This may have been the sole cause of the wb status crash although I'm not sure of that. In
  any event, I've been using the command a bunch while testing and haven't seen it crash since I fixed that.

* Fixed bug where the max_num_bots config setting didn't do what you'd think it would do. See here for more details: http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1238052&forum_id=262472 

* Fades should now use metabolize if they can and are hurt.

Added new testing command "wb evolve <lifeform>". Forces all bots to evolve to that lifeform when possible. For example, "wb evolve fade". 
 
* Tweaked fade movement and blink code. Still needs more work but fades should move around significantly faster. 
 
* Fixed Linux build (assertions were enabled but should have been disabled). 

* Added a new bot behaviour, AmbushStrategy. Skulks will wait at ambush waypoints when marines are heard
  nearby. Ambushing is disabled in NS:Classic if a phasegate is seen. 

* Added a new command, "wb wpambush". When in the debugger, it toggles the nearest waypoint as being an ambush waypoint
  (or back to not being an ambush waypoint). 

* Added rudimentary hearing system. It's not used for much at all at the moment. Bots hear "noisy" marines and remember
where they heard them. There's a lot of possible applications for this system in the future. 

* Bot assignment to roles is now controlled from the config file (whichbot.txt). Bots are either assigned to a pack or
  are in scout/ambush mode. 

* Tweaked waypoint debugger highlighting a bit. Almost all "special" waypoints are now green in the debugger.
