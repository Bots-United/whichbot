Version .6 of WhichBot is ready!

This release is intended to be a compatibility release - the bot should
now be compatible with NS2.0.  Note that this release IS NOT backwards compatible
with NS1.04.

Tactics for the bots have not been updated for NS2.0 yet, and the new
weapons aren't being used, but the bot should still be playable.

It's expected that the next release will improve tactics somewhat as well as usage of the new weapons.

Changes:

[*] Many minor tweaks to get the bot to compile and run properly with NS2.0.
[*] Tweaked waypoints for ns_bast for NS2.0 (thanks to sandmansa).
[*] Hopefully stuck a stake in the evil gorge building bug, so now gorges should build quickly.
[*] ns_eclipse rewaypointed for NS2.0 (thanks to sandmansa).
[*] Waypoints for ns_veil! (thanks to Squidget).
[*] ns_lost rewaypointed for NS2.0 (thanks to Squidget).
[*] ns_tanith tweaked for NS2.0.
[*] Updated bundled Metamod version for compatibility with NS 2.0 (Metamod v1.16.1).
